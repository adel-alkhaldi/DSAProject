<h3> Running The Project </h3>

- To run the project make sure you have Java installed and run the programs from either IDE or CMD, use the report as a reference point as to how the project works and how to use the program's commands
- If you want to use data from your own, make it CSV and place it inside the data structure project itself Project_Test_Data.csv (it has to be in csv format) and the output is in the same file directory as Project_Test_DataOUTPUT.csv (all of this is modifiable in code as a variable, change at your own discretion)
